**Generating Web Forms with Prompts**
=====================================

**Introduction**
---------------

This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to craft effective prompts for generating web forms. By following these guidelines, you can create high-quality web forms that meet your specific needs.

**Understanding the Basics**
---------------------------

Before we dive into the details, it's essential to understand the basic structure of a web form prompt. A typical prompt consists of the following elements:

* **Form type**: Specify the type of form you want to generate (e.g., login, registration, contact, etc.).
* **Fields**: Define the fields you want to include in the form (e.g., username, password, email, etc.).
* **Field types**: Specify the type of field you want to use for each field (e.g., text, password, checkbox, etc.).
* **Validation**: Define any validation rules you want to apply to the form fields (e.g., required, email format, etc.).
* **Additional features**: Specify any additional features you want to include in the form (e.g., captcha, submit button, etc.).

**Prompt Structure**
--------------------

Here's a general outline of a well-structured prompt:

* Start with a clear and concise description of the form type and its purpose.
* List the fields you want to include in the form, along with their corresponding field types.
* Define any validation rules you want to apply to the form fields.
* Specify any additional features you want to include in the form.
* End with a clear call-to-action, such as "Generate the form" or "Create the form code."

**Example Prompts**
-------------------

Here are a few examples of well-crafted prompts:

### Example 1: Simple Login Form

"Create a simple login form with the following fields:
* Username (text field)
* Password (password field)
* Remember me (checkbox)
Include a submit button and validate the username and password fields as required. Generate the form code."

### Example 2: Registration Form with Validation

"Generate a registration form with the following fields:
* First name (text field)
* Last name (text field)
* Email (email field)
* Password (password field)
* Confirm password (password field)
Validate the email field to ensure it's in the correct format and the password field to ensure it's at least 8 characters long. Include a captcha and a submit button. Create the form code."

### Example 3: Contact Form with Custom Fields

"Create a contact form with the following fields:
* Name (text field)
* Email (email field)
* Phone number (tel field)
* Message (textarea)
Include a custom field for the user to select their preferred contact method (phone or email). Validate the email field to ensure it's in the correct format and the phone number field to ensure it's in the correct format. Generate the form code."

**Tips and Best Practices**
---------------------------

* Be clear and concise in your prompt. Avoid using ambiguous language or vague descriptions.
* Use specific field types and validation rules to ensure the generated form meets your requirements.
* Include any additional features you want to see in the form, such as a captcha or submit button.
* Use a clear call-to-action to indicate what you want the model to do with the prompt.

By following these guidelines and examples, you can create effective prompts for generating high-quality web forms that meet your specific needs.
